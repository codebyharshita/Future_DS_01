🧠 Major Insights

45–49 age group generated the highest revenue, despite lower clicks.

CTR stayed stable but low, averaging around 0.01–0.02%.

ROI fluctuated significantly, peaking around mid-campaign.

Ad spend does not always correlate with higher conversions, making optimization essential.

Female audience delivered stronger ROI, while males showed steadier performance.

📌 Conclusion

This analysis highlights clear optimization opportunities:

Redistribute budget to high-ROI age groups

Improve CTR with better creatives & targeting

Reduce CPA by optimizing low-efficiency campaigns

Use gender-wise targeting for better conversion alignment

The dashboard offers a clean, interactive view that enables faster and smarter marketing decisions.
