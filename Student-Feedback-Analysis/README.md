# 🎓 Student Feedback Analysis – Data Analytics Internship Project

## 📌 Project Overview
Student feedback is often collected after academic sessions, workshops, or courses — but raw feedback alone has no value unless it is analyzed meaningfully.

This project focuses on analyzing **student feedback data** using **Python, SQL-style logic, and basic NLP techniques** to uncover insights related to teaching quality, course structure, difficulty level, and overall satisfaction.

The goal is to convert **raw feedback into actionable insights** that can help educators and institutions improve learning experiences.

## 📂 Dataset Information
- **File Name:** `student_feedback.csv`
- **Source:** Simulated student feedback dataset
- **Type:** Rating-based feedback (1–5 scale)
- **Rows:** 1000+ student responses

### Key Columns:
- Well versed with the subject  
- Explains concepts in an understandable way  
- Use of presentations  
- Degree of difficulty of assignments  
- Solves doubts willingly  
- Structuring the course  
- Provides support beyond syllabus  
- Course recommendation based on relevance

## 🔍 Key Analysis Performed
✔ Data cleaning & handling missing values  
✔ Conversion of raw scores into 1–5 rating scale  
✔ Average rating calculation for each feedback category  
✔ Distribution analysis using box plots & histograms  
✔ Correlation and comparison between different feedback parameters  
✔ Sentiment analysis on sample comments  
✔ Insight generation & recommendations  

---

## 📊 Visualizations Included
- Average rating per feedback category (Bar Chart)  
- Rating distribution across parameters (Box Plot)  
- Satisfaction trend analysis  
- Word cloud & sentiment-based insights  

All visualizations are designed to be **clean, readable, and presentation-ready**.

---

## 💡 Key Insights
- Overall student feedback indicates a **moderately positive learning experience**.
- Most ratings lie between **3 and 4**, showing consistent satisfaction.
- Strong correlation observed between:
  - Clear explanations → better understanding  
  - Content quality → course relevance  
- Sentiment analysis highlights mostly positive feedback, with a few concerns around **pace and engagement**.
- Students appreciate subject knowledge but expect **better presentation style and slower delivery pace**.

---

## 📌 Recommendations
- Improve pacing of sessions to accommodate diverse learners  
- Increase interactivity during lectures  
- Enhance visual presentation quality  
- Maintain strong subject expertise and doubt-solving support
